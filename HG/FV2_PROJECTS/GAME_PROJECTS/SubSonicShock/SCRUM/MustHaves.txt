
1. Where there is UI, that UI must be professional and have smooth transitions.

2. Exploding animation when character dies. Steal the megaman style explosion with pause of screen.

3. Plasma-Glow around bombs before they detonate. This will make an effect of showing you the direction of the bombs
   when the light around you mixes with the plasma surrounding the bomb.
   This glow will be rendered to the pre-baked plasma map. using our PropLightTilemap, we can easily attach baked lights 
   to the bombs.
   
   DON'T link bombs together in groups. Which bombs trigger is very dependent on detonation order.
   If a big bomb is next to a short bomb. Detonating the long bomb will also detonate the short bomb.
   But NOT the other way around.

3. Music Streaming. See if it is possible to do said act from newgrounds storage space.
   Plan B:
	   Advertise an EXTENDED sound-track in the the desktop version of the game, with DRM-FREE MP3.
       That is no where near as good as the streaming. Only do plan B if you have no way to stream the
	   audio.

4. Website where people can purchase game.

5. AIR desktop version of the game that allows: 2X and 3X scales of game

6. Non-Obtrusive in-game adds.

7. Make use of the reg-rec dialog boxes!!!
  
8. Level meta data tagger tool.
