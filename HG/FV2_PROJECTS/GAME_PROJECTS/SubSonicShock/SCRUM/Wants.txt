Falling coal tiles catch fire if explosion hits them. Once they catch fire, they can start falling.
They are different than falling columns:
	1. They fall FASTER than the player can fall. (Don't have to worry about jumping off them)
	2. They are on fire. You take 1HP damage if you touch them.
	3. They explode into a ball of sparks when they finally hit the ground.
	   This ball of sparks can ignite other bombs. Sparks take 1HP damage.
	4. They fall ONE BLOCK at a time. There is a delay between blocks falling.
	   ONLY BLOCKS TOUCHING THE "AIR" (empty space) can be on fire.
	   As coal blocks peel off, the next one touching the AIR can then light on fire.
	5. If coal block is 
	      1. COVERED FROM AIR
		  2. BEFORE IT STARTS Falling
		  Then that coal block will have it's flames smothered.
		  

2. Shattering Glass Tiles.
These are tiles that will shatter and break when a falling column crushes them.
The weight from a falling column can also cause them to shatter.

I don't want the shatter to be immediate though. The delay will get more interesting effects.

How Delay?
Some tiles on tilemap have HP. And every frame, a falling column reduces the HP of the tile.
Could also have it so if you jump too much on a glass tile, it shatters... Nope... Don't do that...

QUICK WAY to impliment this without having to refactor color pallet to use Tertiaries:
	the YELLOW lights break when something hard hits them. Makes no sense to do this to the green
	lights because they leave scaffolding.

3. Lasers that emit sparks out the back of them when they are tripped.

4. Laser that instead of being a laser, is a force field.
   Instead of the back throwing out sparks, the back is a button you must press to turn the forcefield off.
   You can touch either relay of the force field to turn it on or off.
   
   IT IS A TOGGLE BUTTON.
   
   If blocks touch it, they can get the toggle STUCK.
