

Company Plan, Year 2:
With money I have now saved up, we will invest in getting games that hit our standards onto the ManaMark Partner Games Portal.
Basically, what WIMP is like to YOUTUBE, MANAMARK is to Game Portals.

Only games that hit our benchmark of quality will be allowed on.

We pay them 500.00 up front for:
1. Right to have their game on our portal.
2. They must put one of the following, visible either in main menu, or always visible (their choice)
   A. Link that says, "MOBILE VERSION" or "DESKTOP VERSION" or "SOUND TRACK"
      That links back to ManaMark website, where you can buy the mobile version, desktop version, or sound track.
4. You must offer DESKTOP VERSION of your GAME AND SOUNDTRACK for purchase on ManaMark.com.
5. We take a 10% cut of sales from this deal.



Programmer Plan:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At some point, multiple projects, hinging on ONE programmer is going to become a serious problem.
How do I solve this?


I hire a programmer EMPLOYEE who does not have rights to my code.
Programmer has rights to a percentage bonus based on how much the game makes.
But the programmer does NOT have right to my code...

HIRE A PROGRAMMER.... SMARTER THAN ME, that documents code well.

Reasoning for smarter than me:
1. Get the best you can get for your buck.
2. If you cannot detect bullshit while talking with them, they are pretty good.


PROGRAMMER JOBS:
UI,TOOLS,GRAPHICS,SYSTEMS
Ideally, none of these jobs overlap, so we will rarely have to do code merges.
