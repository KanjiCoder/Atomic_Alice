Profit devision:
	50% re-invested in company.
		Other 50% of profits devided among people who work in company.
		
		Of the re-invested 50%, everyone in company gets a "share" of that re-investment money
		Which they can use to back an in-house project. There area always at least two in-house
		projects going, which we compete against each other with.
		
		When it comes to profit sharing, you get more profits for backing sucessfull projects.
		And you also get profits from working on a successful team.
		So since you cannot BACK YOUR OWN PROJECT, you can still make money if your project is successfull.
		
		
		
		Profits among projects you participate in are split completely equally.
		No. That wont work for my model of having flexible hours.
		
		You punch-in, punch-out. And log your hours.
		Every week we talk about how much people have contributed.
		
		No logging of hours. Based on what is produced alone.
		
		
		How do you judge the value of what is produced?
