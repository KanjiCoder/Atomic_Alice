Spiders come out of ventillation ducts after certain amount of time.
The vents shake and you hear rattling sound, and then the grate comes off and the flow out.
Maybe there is an animated fan? I like spinny stuff.

Anyways, the grate on the vent shakes and rattles.
The grate falls off.
Spiders spew out and start chasing you.
You get 3 hits and then you are dead.

Grates can be stopped by having blocks fall in front of them.
Or you can just finish the level in time...


Ignition buttons:
They blow up if tiles fall onto the PLUNGER part of the button.
And also emit a HUGE SPARK that reaches further than a normal blast from the spark plug.
After this happens, the spark plug goes into it's DESTROYED state.

The 2x2 and 2x3 plungers have a GREY destroyed state that will be used for all the different ignition button colors.
