

Viles of liquid. Like in first resident evil movie.
These tanks have something in it. but you cannot tell what it is.
These viles break if an explosion hits them.

After they break, the lights turn off.
You hear something creeping.

Little tiny spiders rush past you in the dark.
Tiny ones. The size of a spec.

This sets up the ones that are bigger that will come out of the vents later.
