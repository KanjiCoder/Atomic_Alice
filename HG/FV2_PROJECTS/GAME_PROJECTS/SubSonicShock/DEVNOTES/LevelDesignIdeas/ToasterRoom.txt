IDEA: Each level needs a theme designated by the props within that room.
The theme can be somewhat ridiculous if you want, but you need better level names than
"Level 6"

I had a hard time communicating with Amanda about what level was what.

How do we do this?

One unique prop per level. They can be ridiculous props if you wish.

1. The toaster room. Has random toasters all around the place.
2. The oven room, has random ovens.
3. The locker room, has random lockers.
