1. Rescue bunnies
2. Kill and place turrets like in bolo.
3. Levels look more like places by drawing them out.
4. TRON GLOW on edge of all tiles. Color-Coded so as to re-enforce what tile does what.

GLOW KEY:
BLUE == Bashable.
CYAN: No platform.
BLUE: Platform

WHITE GLOW: Non-bashable.

IDEA: RAIL CANNON:
1. Get into it by pressing --> (Walking into it).
   It is a dead-end. So now, since you cant go anywhere by pressing forward,
   now pressing forward SHOOTS.

2. UP and DOWN move the rail cannon up and down the track.

3. Pressing <-- (BACK arrow) gets you out of the cannon.


Thought:
I want at least 1,000 beta-testers.
We will do this by asking beta-testers to refer me to other good beta testers.
When we hit 1,000 beta-testers, we are ready to release.
