What if there were object that...
They are sprites... But they render by DEFORMING a subsection of the baked lighting map they are on?
They would look at whatever is on the lighting buffer, and distort it.
Could get some interesting phantom looking enemies that way.

But you would need a test square that could distort the lighting system in a cool way.

How would it plug into the lighting system?

Fractal flame fantom sounds pretty cool idea.
