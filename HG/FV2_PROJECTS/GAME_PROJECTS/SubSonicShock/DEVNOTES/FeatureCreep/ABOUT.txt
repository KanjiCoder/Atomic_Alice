Keep a folder for all of the features you would like to add to the game.
That way you don't forget about them, but don't feel forced to code any cool idea you think about.
As time goes on, some cool idea may be EASIER to impliment because of the current code-base already in place.

(Because no matter what you make, your code base is always growing).

Right now... I think electrically conductive tiles are an AWESOME idea.
Also... I still need to work on my TileClinger object that is supposed to make buttons fall.
But my priority is making falling columns right now.

Those other features can go in the sequel to my game.
