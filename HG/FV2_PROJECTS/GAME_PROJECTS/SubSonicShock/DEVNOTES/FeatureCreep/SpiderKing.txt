Idea to make game better:
"The Spider King"
Think of how lakeview cabin did not seem like a horror game until later.
Do that!

In fact, market the game as a happy sparkly game!

If you take too long on a puzzle, the spider king comes.

He is a small guy with a large axe. Maybe 1.5 * 1.5 tiles big character with a 1X2 axe or something.
Little hopping spiders follow him around.

The spiders hop when they move. Forget the gripping stuff you tried to do.
They can invert gravity and hop on the ceiling.
They can invert gravity and hop of the walls.
They get to you by hopping.
They also can shoot thread to get to you.
They shoot thread as a last resport if they cannot hop to get to you.

Spider king uses axe to break down walls. It may take a while.
He moves slowly. You get 3-to-7 axe hits befor a wall breaks open.
Actually different malerials should have different tolerances for when they break.

Level is designed so spiders do not get to you until the spider king has busted a hole in the walls.
