To re-enforce the correlation between bomb graphic and the type of explosion pattern it makes.
It will be easier to see the different explosion patterns if they are different colors.


Every bomb type needs a different sprite sheet.
This is because most people who play do NOT see the connection between the different bombs.

There will be only 3 bomb types in final game.

1. Red Skulls.
   Explosion Color: RED
   Explosion Pattern: 4 way, small.

2. Magenta Bomb:
   Explosion Color: Magenta.
   Explosion Pattern: 4 way, LARGE.

2. Orange Bomb:
   Explosion Color: Orange.
   Explosion Pattern: Horizontal.

3. Yellow Bomb:
   Explosion Color: Yellow
   Explosion Pattern: Vertical.

Hmm... Don't want to use:
Blue, Cyan, Or Green. Those are "safe" colors.
