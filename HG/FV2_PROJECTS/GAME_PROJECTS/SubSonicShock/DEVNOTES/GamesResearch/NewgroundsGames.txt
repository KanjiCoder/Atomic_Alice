                             Like this game more, I like the level select that shows
                             a preview of the level on the screen.
                             The ability to not have to play a level that is too hard
                             is pretty awesome. I could do this in level design by
                             having 3 ways to exit the level.

4.1 stars. I think I like it more the sequel. Even though the sequel does
some unique things.

Art isn't that good. I get lost when I play.
I get the idea that you recharge your powers when you take damage.
Neeto... But why should I care?
