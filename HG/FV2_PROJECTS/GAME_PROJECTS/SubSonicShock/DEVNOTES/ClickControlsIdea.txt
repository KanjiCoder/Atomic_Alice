You click, and he tries to go where-ever you click.

How do you jump?


CLICK: He goes.
HOLD + RELEASE: He jumps at the angle, and SPEED you specify.

Click ONCE near him: He sets a flare box.
Click TWICE near him: He sets a flare box and kicks it.

This could would well with a mouse!
I should make a click interface an make a game based off of that.

Could make a ClickAble version of all side scrollers this way.
Have an alternate tile set you use with them maybe?
Hmm... Have to think about it.
