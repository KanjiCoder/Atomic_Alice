Game fractals should take a few arguments:
	
	1. The tilemap in use.
	2. The tilemap's background image.
	3. The camera used for the tilemap.
	4. The light and plasma buffers maybe?
	
	Want to make something that looks cool enough that I can post screen shots as fractal art on deviant art.
	
	
	
	Effects Idea:
	The pink-green slices effect could use:
		The green as an alpha multiplier to the visible tilemap.
		 Meaning, when green is showing, the tilemap there is showing.
		 
		 Could use PINK as a lighting system deleter.
		 Meaning when pink is showing, the light from the system is NOT showing.
		 OR the pink could be places where PINK LIGHT is stampped onto the lighting system, which is still going.
