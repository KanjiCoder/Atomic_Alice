Loss Aversion is greater motivator than gaining points.
IMPLIMENT: Your score works by holding onto your money instead of losing it.
           Every time you die, you lose money or something.

IMPLIMENT: Characters in the game that if you do not save them, they die.


RISKY IDEA:
Make your game HARD to play. You need a pass-code to play the game.
Or some other exclusionary tactict.
No one wanted to eat the potato until it was declared a royal vegetable,
and only royalty could have it... How do I apply this to my game?

Maybe better: Rewards only for exceptional people?
Like passcodes that you can only get if you work super hard for them.


If you forget yourself, we forget you.
Enter Name:
Passcodes are linked to your name.


No correlation between quality and enjoyment. Only your PERCEPTION of quality.
Example: People enjoy all wines equally. Until you tell them one wine is more expensive
and then they enjoy the more expensive one more.

Logic: Price your game higher, and people will enjoy it more.
Have it go on one day sales. ETC.


People have more Money at beginning of the month. Less at end of month.
