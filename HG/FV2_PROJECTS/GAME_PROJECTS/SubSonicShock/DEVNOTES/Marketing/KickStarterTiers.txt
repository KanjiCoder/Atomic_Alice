AND: Burnt CD of game. Including my development notes and marketing research notes. And the contents of our IMGUR account that include
        early game screen shots and sketchbook scans.

LIMITED: (only 3 available)
(100 votes for what feature you want in the game. AND:::)
$500.00: Get one of my 3 development sketchbooks. Jam packed with notes on every single page about ideas for Atomic Alice.
         Also contains other game ideas as well. If you get rich off and idea in my book, all I ask is you give me honorable mention
         when IGN is interviewing you.

$1000.00: Given the current dev-version of the game my artist, level designer, and PR person use.
          You may create and name one level a week. If it is up to our standards, we will put it in the official release of
          the game, and attribute the level to you in the game credits.

$2000.00: Guarantee a feature from our feature creep list makes it into the game.



Logic for how much to put goals at:
I personally want 500.00 for each feature I put into the game.
I want 20% overhead for company. And then the remainder split 5 ways.
Each share should be 500.00 dollars.
... 3,200.00 per feature. Will result in 512.00 dollars per person on my team.

Vote-Able feature list:
1. The Rope. When pressing the jump button while in the air, you will thow a rope up to the ceiling that you can climb.
   Think Spelunky. Because that is exactly where I am stealing the idea from.

2. Glass Tubes of shattering suprise. There will be large glass tubes in the game. What is inside them? A resident-evil style monster?
   A swarm of bio-mechanical flesh-eating spiders? Corrosive acid? No one knows. But if you accidentially shatter them, there will be trouble.

3. The Corner Buster Bomb. A bomb that explodes radially instead of in a cross pattern. Could be good for developing more interesting puzzles.

4. Lazer Trip-Wire Ignition System:
   Works on a similiar concept as the current ignition buttons in the game. But instead of pressing a button, you trip a laser trip wire
   that causes the laser base-station to emit a spark and detonate a booby-trap.

5. Dr. Who Weeping Angles. There will be statues that only move in the pitch black dark. As long as you can see where they are, they can't hurt you.

6. Bunny Rabbit Rescue: Crates with bunny rabbits. Besides getting out of the level alive, you can choose to rescue the bunny rabbits.
   You will get bunny rabbit points.

7. Water and Acid Water. There will be water tiles in the game. Some water could be acidic and slowly drain your health if you get into it.

8. Tron Mode: Exposed edges of tilemap geometry that are in the dark will emit a neon glow. This will help you visualize the topology of
   the level without giving away what enemies lay in the darkness.

9. Fractalize: When you pause the game, the level will become a living fractal. There will be a feature to save a screen shot of the paused level
               if you see something really cool that you like.

10. Turret Bashing. 3 turret gun enemys will be added to the game. You can destroy them by bashing them with your head before they shoot you.

11. NPC motivated story line. NPC's with dialog boxes including close-up portraits of the character.
    Will be used for in-game events that will progress the story line.

12. Comic Book Panels. Between each level load. We will include a comic book panel that progresses the story.

13. Rail Cannon. A cannon that will move vertically, up and down when you get inside of it by pressing UP/DOWN buttons.
    When you press forward, it will shoot a powerful molatave coctail across the level. When you press backwards, you will exit the rail cannon.

14. Force-Field:
    There will be force-fields that can be turned on and off. They can be used as bridges, blast shields, and barricades against persuing enemies.

15. Burnable Bricks: Bricks in the game that catch fire after an explosion blast hits them. Touching the fire diminishes your health.
    And after the brick is done burning, it disintigrates and compromises the structural integrity of the level.

16. Glass bricks. If a falling tile hits a glass brick. The glass brick will shatter.

17. Helper Drone: A helper drone you can (build,buy,unlock) that follows you aroud and shoots at enemy NPCs in order to protect you.

18. Randomized jump scare. A randomized jump scare that has a 1 in 5,000 chance of occuring in the game at some point in time.
    This chance is calculated once on game startup. If the game decides to give you a jump scare, it will be used at some point
    in the game. Maybe randomized, maybe a specially scripted event for a very specific level. Not telling.

19. Subtle-Scare:
	Ever wonder what it would be like if someone broke into your house every day and moved your furniture by 1mm each day?
	Before you realized it, your couch would be on the other side of the room. You would wonder if it moved, or maybe it was always over there...
	The subtle-scare will be some type of subtle psychological scare. It will be developed to disturb you to the core. You'll feel uneasy, but
	you won't know why. It will get down deep and wreak havock with your subconcious. It will... really help the atmosphere of the game.

20. Table-Flipping. You will be given the ability to flip tables in the game. Why? Fuck tables, that's why.
    However, flip a table, create too much noise... Something might hear you. Be a wreckless vandal at your own discretion.

21. Slow Moving. But un-killable stalker.
    Taking from resident evil 3 nemesis. Or the game clock-tower. There will be a stalker that occassionally pops up in some levels.
    Your stalker can be stalled. But cannot be stopped. Your only option for survival is to get away.

22. 3 Hop-and-bop style enemies. 3 simple enemies that can be killed by jumping on top of them.

23. Octopus ghost weiling a light sabre. If you get hit by it's sabre, you will lose health.

24. Nuke The Level. A special cheat in the game will allow you to become invincible, and lay bombs wherever you feel like.
    You will be given the ability to completely obliterate the level. You also can fly. Because... with ultimate power comes...
    a lot of potential soft-locks that could be handled by flying.

20 * 2,000.00 == 40,000.00
