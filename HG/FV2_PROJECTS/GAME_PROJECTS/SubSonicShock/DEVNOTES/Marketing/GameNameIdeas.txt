I had a watermark layer that put me on the brink of lagging: 28-29 FPS instead of 30.
Got rid of that, lag went away.

Then I decided to start doing a stress test to find out how fast my code is running.
I bumped my game FPS to 60FPS.

Played game, the highest it could achieve was 40-41FPS while playing.

Got rid of my timer box, which involves updating non-blitted text every frame of the game.
(Its like a stopwatch for the game that keeps track of high-scores for each level)

Now the frame rate hit it's cap of 60FPS.

I am going to aim for 120FPS.
My game will be made to run at 30FPS, but I would like it to run smoothly at 120FPS
so that I have a safe cushion.

I am not confortable having my game "on the brink of lag" where if I add just one more
layer to the stage, the game is done for.

IDEA:
ALPHABETICAL MATTERS. Having an attitude matters.
Game name idea from that:
Adam Smash
Alice Smash
AS4 AS4


Flames should pour down from tiles when you smash them with your head.

IDEA: Fire-ball tiles:
When they become ACTIVATED, they will fall and burst into a column of flames.
They spread like fire. Think the game "Playing with fire" accept they create a falling fire-column hazard.

Use this effect:

How they fall:
1. Always in 1x1 tile units.
2. Their is a big delay before they start falling.
   So that a column on the ceiling can be more spread apart.
3. They fall as flaming blocks, and explode into firey columns when they land.
4. Maybe the tile STROBES right before it falls.

Other tile properties:
1. The tile is "INVINCIBLE"
2. The tile does NOT need things below it to keep it from falling.
3. tile only falls when it has been heated up.
4. Tile becomes fireball as it falls.
5. tile leaves coins after it explodes. But you must wait for flames to pass.
6. Tiles SPREAD FIRE to other tiles of this type.
