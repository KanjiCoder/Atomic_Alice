An idea copying from pokemon and giving more significance to death:

The things you can rescue are living creatures that can attack and fend off enemies for you.
BUT, as you play, if the one you are trying to rescue dies, you cannot get that one for the entire game.
You must start a new game.

Once you have them, you can spawn them to protect you.
In an escape-goat sort of fashion.
