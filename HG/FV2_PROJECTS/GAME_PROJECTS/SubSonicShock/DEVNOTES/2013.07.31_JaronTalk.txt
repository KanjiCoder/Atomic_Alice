2. Make him like mario. He can bust bricks with his head. You are always journeying downward,
so, this could work. Also, he cannot bust bricks to the right or left or down. Just above his
head.

3. Could have an interactive menu selection where he busts bricks with his head.

4. Need flag in code that kills ALL UI in the game.
   This way I can figure out if my UI is slowing down the game.
   
5. Take UI out of the main screen.

6. Maybe... At the begining of each level, have a brick placed that you can hit.
   Hitting this brick opens up the in game menu. You cannot get to this brick any other way.
