//TODO:
	1: Make Boxes have light source around them. This will help you see where they are going when you push them!
	
	AHH!!!
	The darkness color is a dark-grey most of the time...
	But when the stalker appears:
		1. Darkness turns dark-red.
		2. After turning dark-red, darkness turns pitch black.
		
		During the time it was dark red, you can see the dark-black shilloutte of the dangerous stalker that
		is now after you. You can use event areas that will trigger the stalker in your game.
		
		OR!! You could make invisible objects that, when you collide with them trigger the stalker.
		OR!! Like in Clock Tower... Make it so that hitting a set object and breaking it makes noise.
		And that evokes the stalker. Might not be best since bombs always make noise.
		
		IDEA: Scary Door. Slowly opens and enemy pours out of it.
