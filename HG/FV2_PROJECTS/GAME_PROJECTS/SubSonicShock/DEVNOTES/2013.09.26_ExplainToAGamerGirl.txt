Its a survival-horror side-scrolling puzzle-platformer bomberman-style game.
Judging by your interest in Cosplay, your punisher shirt, and your tattoo of the crow. I am guessing that is a concise yet understandable summary?

How do you like Admin work?



Its a side scrolling bomberman.
Right now I am working on coding blood effects that splatter all over the walls when you die. Everytime you restart a level, you'll see all the places you last died. This will help it give a theme of slow deteroriation of the sanity of the world. Think Silent Hill.
I am basically stealing everything I like about my favorite games, and putting it in this. Right now it is a fun game... But I am not happy with it yet. I want it to be a game that you don't want to play alone in the dark.

It's a fast paced bomberman puzzle platformer(side scroller).
However, my final vision is more of a survival horror game incorporating some elements
from resident evil and clock tower. Right now I am working on coding blood effects
that splatter all over the walls when you die. Everytime you restart a level,
you'll see all the places you last died. Kinda to give it a silent hill theme of slow deteroriation of the sanity of the world you are in.

Judging by your tattoos, interests, and profession,
I am guessing you are familiar with said games?
