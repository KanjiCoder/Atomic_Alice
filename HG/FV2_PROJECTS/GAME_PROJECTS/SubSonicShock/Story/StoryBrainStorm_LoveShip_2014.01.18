Action Story: Action-Dark-Comedy
You are a mechanic on a star ship. One day after surfing too much internet porn on the holo-deck, the 
ship computer got a virus. The ship is now in love with you and is trying to keep you on board, forever.

You are inside a spaceship, and you've hit a state of emergency.
Hal doesn't think you should be able to leave. Hal is a lonely robot.
He wants company. He tries to feed you electricity sometimes, but for a robot, he seems not too bright.
Hal wants you to stay. Hal enjoys your time. He doesn't think you should be sharing it with others though.

There are fighter drones that have been over-taken by the ship. They have a hive-mind and are working with the ship to subdue you.
If you destroy the drones, you can re-build them and they will follow you around and protect you. They float and what not.

Dr. Beakerman is also on the ship. But the ship isn't in love with him. So Dr. Beakerman has amnesty. He can roam around without
getting hurt. Dr. Beakerman makes bombs for a living. The same bombs that are killing you. But because we are in the future, robots
can now form legal corporations, and the ship computer has quite a big bank balance.

Dr. Beakerman justifies that, he only makes the bombs. He does not drop them.
Though Dr. Beakerman is free to go as he pleases. He does not try and escape. He does what he likes and no one bother's him.
Except for you. You are always in a life/death situation. And it's a real pain in the ass sometimes.
Sometimes Dr. Beakerman wishes you would wait till after he is done with his soduko puzzle before you come running around the corner
in a distressed panic.
