
While at Sophia's place. Had people play test game.
Biggest problem is that the game is a bit too dark.

Bring up saturation of level.
Darkness should not be completely dark.

IDEA: Give levels self-illumination
      layer for each brick. So that
      in the darkness, edges and what not
      could light up.

Problem: More processing. More potential for
lag. Will have to code it as well.

Pro:
Would look really cool with a tron-style
effect that is occasionally flashing.

half-half:
Sometimes the darkness is not completely dark, sometimes darkness is pitch black
and the things in the dark are glowing.
