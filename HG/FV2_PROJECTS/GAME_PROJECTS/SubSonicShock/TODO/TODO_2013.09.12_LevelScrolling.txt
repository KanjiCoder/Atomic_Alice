
Summary of results I want:
	Parallaxing needs to be FIXED, but never too fast.
	Meaning that, the background is always in the same position for any given player x,y coordinate in the world.
	This way, if writing appeared on the background in a certain area of the level, it will be there if you go back to it.


How does background scrolling work?

IF level is SMALLER than background,
we do a STRAIGHT 1:1 scroll.
Because we will NOT run out of background.

If the level is BIGGER than the background,
we use percentage scrolling.

Either way, background should always be
the same size, or bigger than the scree

Hmm... I would like a bit of parallax even if the BACKGROUND is way bigger than the level.
Scroll percentage should scroll between allowed ranges of map then...

ParallaxMaxScale:int = 1; //1 to 1. No parallaxing when scrolling.
ParallaxMaxScale:int = 0.5; //for every inch the forground moves, the background moves a half inch.
