Game Start:


//Global application state registry
GlobalAppStateReg

How do we keep track of what menus to show when?
1. Make the menus private in the menu registry.
Only access them via "all.showMenuByName(inName)
Like this, so we can keep track of what the previous menu is.

I think we should do this refactor FIRST before we refactor the rest of the game.
As the problem we are having with the game is mainly menu related.


TODO:#2:
LevelReg.incrementLevelNumber <<Fix this hack using GlobalAppStateReg

TODO:#3: When moving keys to unpause, the in-game menu state is wrecked.
Probably because menu is being closed. Fix this!


TODO:#4: Make the editor area of the editor menu able to be made invisible so you can test the game
while the editor is still open and hit "stop" button on level editor.

TODO:#5: Make editor friendly levels in this addition.

if( v1.x != v2.x || v1.y != v2.y )
{

}

if(!(v1.x == v2.x && v1.y == v2.y))
{

}
