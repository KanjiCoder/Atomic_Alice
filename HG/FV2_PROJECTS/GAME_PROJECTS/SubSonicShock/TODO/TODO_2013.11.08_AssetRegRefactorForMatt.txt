Take a look at AssetReg.. Needs a refactor overhaul.
ALSO:
	GenericAssetPack.as
	and
	RegisteredGenericAsset.as
	
	will be playing a big role in this re-factor.
	
	
	I need to figure out how to create an instance of a specific class type, and alter it.
	Specifically for embedding BitmapData.
