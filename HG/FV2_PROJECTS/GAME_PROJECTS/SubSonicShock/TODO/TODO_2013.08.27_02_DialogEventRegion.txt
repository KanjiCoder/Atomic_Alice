Why have "event regions instead of sprite recs that do the same thing?"

1. Event region does not have to be fixed at a super specific size.
2. Event region can have geometry laying in it.


How to denote them?
[C][W]    [W][C]
[W]          [W]


[W]          [W]
[C][W]    [W][C]


Search for white pixels that form rectangle brackets with a colored pixel in their corners.
RGB-CMY are allowed colors.
4 corners, and SIX allowed colors.
How many combinations for event areas do we have?

Could I also do this with DARK AND LIGHT GREYS to make: Foreground and Background art asset rectangles?

1111 --Binary. 4 bites that are off or on (2 states)
5555 --Quadary. 4 bites. With 6 states each. 6*6*6*6 == 1296???? Really??? Do you have that many options?? Awesome.
Actually... Even more...
If you are using LIGHT AND DARK CMY-RGB.... 12*12*12*12.... More combinations than you'll ever need.
With this many combinations, you can have each dialog region combination found unique to the ENTIRE GAME.
No need to re-use.

Make a meta-data file of dialog regions and the text that accompanies them.
