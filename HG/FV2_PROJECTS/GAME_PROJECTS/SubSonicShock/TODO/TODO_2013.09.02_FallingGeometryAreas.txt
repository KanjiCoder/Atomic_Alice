I am guessing it is because the FlxCamera is being disposed and I am not re-initializing things correctly.



Game Name Idea: Brick Burster.
Still like "Bomb Runner" though. As I still remember it.

TODO BEFORE FALLING GEOMETRY:
	CHECK: Just get RegRecs loading into game.
	
	RegRecs are in game... how do I control configuration for what happens now?
	
	Make a NON-STATIC class:
	RegRecManager
	
	That will track to see if character is inside a given RegRec.
	And will do things based on what happens if the character goes into that region.
	
	

Falling Geometry Action Time:
	
	1. Screen Shakes
	2. Geometry falls.
	3. Geometry can crush you to death.
	4. Falling geometry can create blockades in level.

When entering certain event regions... Tiles are deleted from top of event region and turned into "falling geometry"
that can crash down and kill you. When falling geometry hits obstacle on tilemap, the sprite vanishes and it turns back into
normal geometry.


Also:
	Make it so flares you set create a barricade you cannot get past.
	You could also use this to create force field floors that you can only cross when they are on.
	
Also:
	Why not try taking everything you like about megaman levels and putting them into your game mechanics for how
	the level plays?
