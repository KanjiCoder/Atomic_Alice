

In order needed to work on.
1. CollisionBucket.as
2. CollisionBucketBuffer.as
3. PlasmaMapStateSprite.as



Also open tab:
	BufferedPlasmaMap.as
	
	
END RESULT:
	I want thwomps that will CRUSH THROUGH blocks in the game.
	
TODO NEXT: Make object that can tell us if tile is in LIGHT or not:
	 * SINCE ALL LIGHTS ARE DEFINED BY RECTANGLES:
			 * Easy to calculate if objects are in the light or not!
			 * Tilemap should have a "setIsTileInLight(tileX,tileY,true)"
			 * and a getIsTileInLight(tileX,tileY,false)....
			 * TOO specialized!!!
			 * LightLedger.getIsTileInLight
			 * LightLedger has _data:vector.<boolean> that aligns with size of tilemap.
			 *            Dependancies:
				          1. The tilemap
						  2. The plasma Map.
						  When POWER IS OFF on plasma map getIsTileInLight ALWAYS returns FALSE.
		     * IDEA: Two classes of enemy:
				 * 1. Computer: They activate in the light.
				 * 2. Shadow Demon: They move around in the darkness. Freeze in light.
				 
				 
What kind of system can I develop as a way to TEST the Collision bucket collision I have?
Maybe something simple but cool that can be used in game?...
Maybe the TWOMPS are the simplist case to make something cool to test it that can be used in game?

Splotchy sensor areas?
