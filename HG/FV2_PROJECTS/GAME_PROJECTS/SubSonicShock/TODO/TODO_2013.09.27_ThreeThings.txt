1. 4 different explosion colors to go with 4 different bombs.
2. PSS_POD_Processor. Make rotated and transformed sprite sheets so chris can have buttons on walls and ceiling.
3. Finish the Decals so we have support for blood splatter. Finish the props engine as well.


Explosion color is most important because I've noticed a lot of people do not see the correlation between bomb style and it's behavior.
Also, simplified vertical and horizontal bombs. They do not go out at ALL on one of their axis.
This means if you stick VERTICAL bombs on a horizontal line, they will NOT chain.
BUT.... I like this. It makes:
	1. Chained up vert/horizontal bomb configurations in level more obvious.
	2. Cleaner holes blasted through things.
	3. More distinguishable explosion pattern.
	
	If players cannot recognize patterns, how are they going to figure out puzzles?
	
	Also,I have noticed changes have made it easier for me to visualize construction of a level.
	 If I am having a hard time thinking about how it goes together and i am creating the level,
	 someone who has never played the game is going to be totally confused.
