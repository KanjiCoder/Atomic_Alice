

Level 01: Coffin Containment Room Idea:
	
	You start in the box. There is no way out. Even when you press up.
	Then the GhostTextEngine prompts:
		
		"Do you want out of here?"
		
	So that you dont have to figure out which button to press to select, there is a timer
	that will go out if you take too long to make a selection.
	
	SELECT: "YES, I want out" :
		You are prompted to press UP ARROW to jump. You do so, and you bust through blocks.
		
	SELECT: "I don't need your help."
	    You are prompted: "Fine, burn in hell."
		The entire level explodes, but something saves you. You can now escape and jump on the platforms
		that remain to do so.
		
		
	Vauge Story:
	There are 3 forces at work:
		
		EVIL:
		1. Something sinister trying to kill you. Very overt in it's intentions.
		   It is a very primal force. When it communicates with you, it is usually
		   also in short fragments like the good force.
		   Only the Amoral force portrays high intellect.
		   The amoral force is a more human force.
		   Because it, in a way, embodies good and evil.
		
		AMORAL:
		2. A sketchy presence that seems to resent you.
		   Offers help, but always wants something in exchange.
		   Doesn't care if you live or die. Ambigious morals.
		  
		GOOD:
		3. A silent force of good that sometimes helps you.
		   It's presence is more subtle. It rarely talks, and when it does,
		   it talks usually in one, two, or 3 word fragments.
		   
		   
	Megaman style "UPGRADE" chambers:
		If you do not get help from AMORAL character in first level,
		Then you will get the upgrade later in the game.
