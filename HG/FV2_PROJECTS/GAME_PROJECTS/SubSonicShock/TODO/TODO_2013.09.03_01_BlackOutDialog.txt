2. Game Pauses.
3. Text is stamped onto the BG, Then there is a temporary stamp on the light and plasma layer that lets you
   see the text clearly.
   
4. The text will show up in paragraph format.
5. When text is done being shown, the lights turn back on.

6. Each time paragraph/page of text changes, the BG jitters into a new position.
   This way the multiple paragraphs stamping onto each other will not make a SOLID blot,
   but a softer better spred out blot when the lights turn back on.
   
7. DIALOG ENGINE:
   The dialog area will be as big as the RegRec that spawned it.
   Otherwords: Dialog Area = Same Size + Position as RegRec.
   
   Since RegRecs take up space, this kind of works, because the reg-rec will always be around to draw on the background.
   Even if reg-rec is NOT around to draw on the background, the light and plasma layers will make it so the text is still
   readable.
   
   
   
   Class to create:
   GhostTextEngine
   GhostTextEngine.init(inCamera, inPlasmaMap)
   or
   GhostTextEngine.init(inCamera, plasmaMap.lightBuffer, plasmaMap.plasmaBuffer);
   
   Hmm... needs tilemap too to determine the correct placements sometimes.
   
   GhostTextEngine.init(inCamera, inTilemap, [plasmaMap.lightBuffer, plasmaMap.plasmaBuffer], [blend1, blend2]);
