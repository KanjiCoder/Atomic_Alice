BadSpriteRecBMM

Using these classes, making modification that will turn bad sprite rectangles into other colors.

WHY:
	1.Good placeholder art.
	2.Sprite rectangles with WHITE in them will be mistaken as lights if the sprite rectangle
	is UNKNOWN and therefor goes unprocessed.
	
---------------------ABOVE DONE!!!


TODO:
	Buy Cigarettes.
	Should I make a bitmap key to automatically create sprite rectangles???
	No... Just figure out the code for the sprite rectangle by hand and come up with the correct string.
	These config settings don't change often enough to justify creating a system.
	
	TODO: Game wise then:
		Finalize that patterns you want for thwomps.
		
NOTE: Weird thing happened where entire tilemap dissapeared... First it was only half of it... Then I reloaded and it was always all of it.
Seems hard to replicate.
