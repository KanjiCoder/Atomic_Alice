You can't debug collision code for things you cannot see. 

Rather than make a debug file and setup stuff...
Debug the actual object that will be using the collision buckets.

Debug for a "Real life" scenario.

Where is my collision bucket example for loading collision data??
Answer: The "bucketStrips" in PlasmaStateSprite

	var x:Boolean = true; //x's mark colliding buckets.
	var o:Boolean = false;//o's mark non-collding buckets.
	var bs:Vector.<Array> = new Vector.<Array>(0);
	bs.push([o, o, o, o, o]);
	bs.push([o, x, x, x, o]);
	bs.push([o, x, x, x, o]);
	bs.push([o, x, x, x, o]);
	bs.push([o, o, o, o, o]);
