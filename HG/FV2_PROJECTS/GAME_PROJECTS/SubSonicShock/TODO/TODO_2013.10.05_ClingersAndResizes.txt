Todo: 2x2 buttons so that when creating levels, I can make things line
up better. Maybe 3x3 doors as well.

Also, work on the clinger helper class sometime.
Problems:
	1. Clinger must ignore stopping on cached revision if the clinger is unimpeeded.
	2. Clinger needs to be teathered to the object it represents. So that clinger does not snap though an opening that
	   later becomes closed to the object that represents it. This will happen if tiles are added to tilemap after they have been deleted.
	   
	   
OOOH: Game Idea: Inverse bombs:
	  When bombs explode, they create tiles.
	  
	  Way to impliment without wrecking original mechanic:
	  The structures they create are a special tile that eventually explodes after it hits a certain age.
	  
	  
BOMB BLAST SIZE:
I am thinking:
Skulls: 4 ways, but only 1 tile each way. So they much be touching to chain.
Magentas: 4 ways, but only 2 tiles each. Allows for a gap of ONE tile.
Thus you can space them out between THIN walls.

The vertical and horizontal will be larger. But not move on one axis.



Two new tile types that are INVINCIBLE:
	PRISM and STEEL
	Prism lets bombs blast go through it, but it itself does NOT break.
	Steel stops the blast. Both are square NON-ANGLE tiles. They have no other states.
