TileStateDatum.as
PropPlacementEngineFunctions.as
FlxTilemapPropFunctions.as
DecalSlice.as

TODO:
	Get the masking tiles into the game. And make them work so that decals never completely bock out
	the original tile map. We want the decals to add a level of depth to the environment.
	NOT become the new environment.
