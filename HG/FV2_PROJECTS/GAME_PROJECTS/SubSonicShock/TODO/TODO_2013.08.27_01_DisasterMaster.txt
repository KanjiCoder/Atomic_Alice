Dialog is conveyed by stamping dialog onto the background image.
Thus, you can keep the background somewhat simple. But make it interesting since
random words sometimes show up that will give it more visual detail.

Still want randomly moving furnature. But the dialog randomly showing up will make things pretty immersive.
And all scary like.

Maybe you can only run when you are in danger?


Just an idea for game.
What do I need now???

1. Do death animations.
2. Scary stalker guy... Where are you?
3. Laser beams in walls?
4. Laser beam enemy that only shoots when you are below it.
5. Fire dripper enemy.
   Launches grenade flare at you or causes fire on ground....
   
   
   TODO:
	   Figure out why the background is being deleted upon occasional new level load.
