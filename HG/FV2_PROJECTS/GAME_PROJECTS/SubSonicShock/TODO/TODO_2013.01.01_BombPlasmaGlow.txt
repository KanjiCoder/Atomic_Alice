AfterMapTilesAndSpritesFinalizedFunctions


The bomb lights should be set after everything is done loading.
Should do this by calling bound function that is linked into a manager.
That is configured to set these lights.

Maybe the LightingEventsManager is responsible for this.
If the game mode is HARD, maybe we don't set these helper lights on the bombs.
Either way, you did far too much work not to test this out.


NOTE:
Light baking in the ray-lit map loader happens after all of the tiles and props have been finalized.
This tells me setting plasma glow around bombs would be best done with a module of some sort.



Need: PropBakerPluginModule.as
You can make one of these that is specialized to alter the baking proceedure of the PropLightTilemap in different ways.


Var mod:PropBakerPluginModule = new PropBakerPluginModule(); //<< More like:: PropLightTilemapSetupPluginModule
mod.setLightPropFetchingFunction( inFuncWithTypes )

//the setLightPropFetchingFunction is used to convert a tile coordinate into a PropSprite to be used for lighting.


function exampleLightPropFetchingFunction(inTileX,inTileY):PropSprite
{
	//looks at the bomb grid and decides which prop sprite to return for this coordinate.
}


var mapLoader:RayLitMapLoader ....
mapLoader.setGlowPluginModule( mod )




Need to establisha constants file for ExplosionSnapBombs
How about: SnapBombConstants.as
