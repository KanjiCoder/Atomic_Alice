	JM_LIB.utils.worldMapTools.mapDecoderEncoder 
	To make a world map editor.
	
	Then was going to lace my FlxTilemap with PropData so that I could make props render super efficiently.
	Basically, all props are cut up into tiles and put into a master vector. Then tiles can have a property
	of "hasProp" if it has a prop, then we look at the propSLICE number to get the correct tile.
	
	A prop that is 2x2 tiles may be made up of propSLICEs 4,5,6, and 7 for example.
	
	
	Might make side project: Dont get squished.
	Objective is to NOT get squished against the walls of the game.
	
	Though I think 4 maps comming at you from all directions would be cool.
	Just focus on ONE map comming at you from the bottom and rushing down.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	1 hour of gameplay.
