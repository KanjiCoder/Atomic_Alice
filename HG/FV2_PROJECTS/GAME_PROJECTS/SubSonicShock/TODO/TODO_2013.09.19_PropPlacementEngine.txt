TODO: Get Decals drawing FIRST.
Because decals are less interactive than props.
Thus, it is logical to get that proof of concept working FIRST
before we move on to getting the props drawing.


1. Make prop placement engine
2. Code necessities for displaying props.
   Don't worry too much about collision, but do code the basic structures for collision as you think of them.
   
   //BELOW:
   //CLASSES CREATED TO GET PROPS UP AND RUNNING IN GAME///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
   
   PropPlacementEngine.as   //Engine that is responsible for spawning props on the tilemap.

   IPropReg.as // An interface implimented by PropReg.
               // PropReg is GAME SPECIFIC, while IPropReg is GAME AGNOSTIC.

   ATileProp.as  //Single prop within TilePropData. Basically, most of Original TilePropData has been gutted and put

   BloodAndSplatterPropPack.as //Props and decals are interchangeable. Made this prop pack to test out decal setting functions.
