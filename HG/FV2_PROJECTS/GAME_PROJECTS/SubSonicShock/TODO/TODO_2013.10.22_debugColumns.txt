	It looks like, colums who's head lays on the 45 degree axis of symmetry at game start
	end up having one block chopped off of their final height when they land.
	Also the timing with other falling blocks somehow matters as well.
	
	I am thinking two errors:
		1. Reference error. Multiple columns are referencing the same ClusterColumnHead.
		2. x/y error. Somewhere where there is an .x there is a .y instead, or vise versa.
		
		I think both problems are happening in combination somehow.
