For efficiency:
An entire props bitmap seems too excessive, because most of that bitmap will
NOT be populated by props.

But having a lot of props will create drawing performace problems.

Solution:
"Prop Blocks"

When engine decides where to randomly put props, it looks to create a spawn area.
A spawn area is a large rectangular area without any tiles in it.

Different levels will have different THEMES set in the meta data
for the level.
